In music, a guitar chord is a set of notes played on a guitar.
A chord's notes are often played simultaneously, but they can be played sequentially in an arpeggio.
The implementation of guitar chords depends on the guitar tuning. Most guitars used in popular music have six strings with the "standard" tuning of the Spanish classical guitar, 
namely E-A-D-G-B-E' (from the lowest pitched string to the highest); in standard tuning, the intervals present among adjacent strings are perfect fourths except for the major third (G,B). 
Standard tuning requires four chord-shapes for the major triads.
There are separate chord-forms for chords having their root note on the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth strings. For a six-string guitar in standard tuning, 
it may be necessary to drop or omit one or more tones from the chord; this is typically the root or fifth. 
The layout of notes on the fretboard in standard tuning often forces guitarists to permute the tonal order of notes in a chord.
